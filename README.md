Task 2 involves testing RESTful APIs using Postman to verify key functionalities like authentication (e.g., user login) and data retrieval (e.g., fetching user profiles or product lists). Postman is used to send HTTP requests (GET, POST) to the API endpoints, validate responses (status codes and data), and ensure that the API behaves as expected with and without proper authorization.
